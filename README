Heliotrope is a personal, threaded, search-centric email server.

It is a work in progress.

Trying it out:

1. Install your distro's TokyoTyrant or TokyoCabinet libraries. On Ubuntu, it's
   `sudo apt-get install libtokyocabinet8`.
2. `gem install trollop whistlepig console rest-client sinatra rubymail oklahoma_mixer`
3. ruby -Ilib bin/heliotrope-server &
4. ruby -Ilib bin/heliotrope-add -h

Use heliotrope-add to add some email. It is slow, but it works.

DEBUGGING / EXPERIMENTAL HTML INTERFACE
---------------------------------------

Point your browser to http://localhost:8042. This HTML interface is for
debugging, experimental, and development purposes.  It is not pretty, but it is
functional, and should give you an idea of what types of responses the server
can provide.

JSON INTERFACE FOR CLIENTS
--------------------------

Coming soon!

Heliotrope is a personal, search-centric, threaded email server. It provides a
backend service against which email clients / MUAs can be written.

Heliotrope provides all the features you actually want in a modern email
client:

- fast, full-text search over all messages
- automatic threading
- arbitrary labels
- a sophisticated query language
- support for signed and encrypted email
- an extensible JSON-over-HTTP API

Heliotrope is a work in progress. It is not stable. It is not tested.

WHY ANOTHER PROTOCOL? WHY NOT JUST USE IMAP? 

Because IMAP is terrible and you want all those features listed above.

REQUIREMENTS

Heliotrope is written in a mixture of Ruby and C. You will need a working C
compiler, and a modern Ruby. 1.8.7 or 1.9.2 are good choices.

Heliotrope uses html2text to generate text from HTML attachments. You will
need this or some reasonable alternative.

Do this:
0. Install html2text. On Debian-based Linux distros, it's `sudo apt-get
   install html2text`.
1. Install your distro's TokyoTyrant or TokyoCabinet libraries. On
   Debian-based Linux distros, it's `sudo apt-get install libtokyocabinet8`.
2. Install a modern Ruby. I recommend 1.9.2. On Debian-based Linux distros,
   you can try the ruby1.9.1 package. Or you can download and compile it from
   http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/.
3. Run `gem install trollop whistlepig console rest-client sinatra rmail
   oklahoma_mixer` (or gem1.9.1 if you're using the Debian version).
4. mkdir <mailstore> # wherever you want heliotrope to store its stuff

RUNNING IT

First, follow the REQUIREMENTS above.

Then, `git clone https://github.com/wmorgan/heliotrope.git` and run `ruby
-Ilib bin/heliotrope-server -d <mailstore>`. (Or ruby1.9.1 if you're using the
Debian thing.)

Heliotrope exposes a simple debugging HTML interface. If you point your
browser to http://localhost:8042, you should see your empty mailstore.

IMPORTING SOME MAIL

First, kill your server. You can add emails to the server one at a time when
it's running (see ADDING EMAIL), but for bulk imports, it's much faster to
avoid the HTTP overhead.

Add a pre-existing mbox:
  ruby -Ilib bin/heliotrope-add -m <mbox> -d <mailstore>

Add a pre-existing maildir:
  ruby -Ilib bin/heliotrope-add -a <maildir> -d <mailstore>

Add a pre-existing IMAP account: (slow!)
  ruby -Ilib bin/heliotrope-add -i <imap server> -d <mailstore>

You're looking at around 50 messages/sec, so you might want to limit the
number of emails imported with --num-messages if you're just playing around.

Ok, now restart the server. You should see stuff at http://localhost:8042.

ADDING EMAIL

Once the server is running, you can use heliotrope-add to add individual
emails as they arrive.

To add a single email:
  cat email.txt | ruby -Ilib bin/heliotrope-add

Once Heliotrope is production-ready, I'll add some documentation about
procmailrc or whatever.

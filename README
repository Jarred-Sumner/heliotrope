Heliotrope is a personal, search-centric, threaded email server. It provides a
backend service against which email clients / MUAs can be written. It features:

- email storage and retrieval, of course
- full-text search over all messages
- email threading
- arbitrary labels
- a sophisticated query language
- built-in handling of signed and encrypted email
- a fast, JSON-over-HTTP API

Heliotrope is a work in progress. It is not stable. It is not tested.

Trying it out:

1. Install your distro's TokyoTyrant or TokyoCabinet libraries. On Ubuntu, it's
   `sudo apt-get install libtokyocabinet8`.
2. `gem install trollop whistlepig console rest-client sinatra rubymail oklahoma_mixer`
3. ruby -Ilib bin/heliotrope-server &
4. ruby -Ilib bin/heliotrope-add -h

Once the server is running, you can use heliotrope-add to add some email. It is
slow, but it works.

Add a single email:
  cat email.txt | ruby -Ilib bin/heliotrope-add

Add a pre-existing mbox:
  ruby -Ilib bin/heliotrope-add -m <mbox>

Add a pre-existing maildir:
  ruby -Ilib bin/heliotrope-add -a <maildir>

Add a pre-existing IMAP account:
  ruby -Ilib bin/heliotrope-add -i <imap server>

Once email has been added to Heliotrope, you can discard it. (Ok, maybe wait
until Heliotrope is stable first.) Now point your browser to
http://localhost:8042 for a simple demo of the API calls.

DEBUGGING / EXPERIMENTAL HTML INTERFACE
---------------------------------------

Point your browser to http://localhost:8042. This HTML interface is for
debugging, experimental, and development purposes.  It is not pretty, but it is
functional, and should give you an idea of what types of responses the server
can provide.

JSON API

Coming soon!
